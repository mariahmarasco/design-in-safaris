  Further Research

  <p id="p2"> 
  After my initial research in week 1 of the Arctic Fox enrichment process, I began to dive deeper into the movement (leaping into the air with an arched back and pouncing down front paws/head-first into the snow with precision) that an arctic fox displays as a hunting tactic in the wild. While I was also interested in encouraging social behavior between arctic foxes, I was unable to find any documentation about arctic fox socialization. In fact, arctic foxes are known for being lonely animals as they often mate multiple times (monogamous) and do not exhibit pack or family bonding behavior.

  I began thinking about how this way of moving that I have mentioned above could be used for alternative goals besides catching prey.
