<h2>See and Move Like a Starfish</h2>

  Phenomenon: "Eye Spots"
  </p>
 
  <p id="p2"> 
  Starfish don't have brains, or eyes in the sense that we as humans are used to. So how do they see and find their way home? With little dots on the end of each arm called "eye spots". These eye spots are able to detect light versus dark (as long as an object isn't moving past too quickly). Because their home, the reef, never moves, they are drawn back home as their eye spots lead them based on the light that emits off the reef.

  Empathy Machine: Concept
  </p>
 
  <p id="p4"> 
  Assume user has their eyes closed. Create a machine that indicates the presence of a light source by "guiding" the users arm/hand in the associated direction.

  Empathy Machine: Motivation
  </p>
 
  <p id="p6"> 
  For those of us humans who are blessed with all 5 functioning senses, we often rely on vision to guide us through the world. What would happen if both vision and free will are taken away? This project aims to articulate to humans what it would be like to be guided through the world (one of darkness) as opposed to choosing which directions we move with our brain. How can this be applied to the visually impared community in the human environment?
