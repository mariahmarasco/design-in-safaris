  Inspiring Digging/Burrowing to Evade Predators
  </p>
 
  <p id="p2"> 
  The European rabbit, which originated in France and Northwest Africa, is the common ancestor of the various (80+) breeds of domestic rabbits that we have today. While these wild rabbits—having been introduced to most continents except Asia and Antarctica—are now considered pests in many areas such as Australia where they are destroying ecosystems, their population is diminishing in their region of origin (Europe), putting them on the IUCN red list for this area.

  <p id="p4"> 
   <b>Activities</b>
  <br>
  <br>Drink same amount of water as a 20lb dog each day
  <br>Daily playtime (at least 4 hours of playtime per day: time to run around, explore, etc. especially if the rabbit is housed in a cage not an open room)
  <br>They do not hone the digging skill like their wild brothers who borough under the ground in tunnels
  <br>Best-case scenario can run up to 30 mph but very rare

  <br>
  <br><b>Environment</b>
  <br>
  <br>Hay (keeps it fresh and encourages them to eat more)
  <br>They like to run through tunnels
  <br>
  <br><b>Interaction</b>
  <br>
  <br>Love & Attention (including petting and snuggling)
  <br>Cuddling with other rabbits
  <br>Someone on Youtube taught their rabbit to use a claw machine

  <br>
  <br><b>Object</b>
  <br>
  <br>Food = lettuce, kale, field greens, fresh vegetables
  <br>Pellets (food)
  <br>Water (from a dish not a water bottle because they are not natural)

  Concept: Inspire Digging/Tunneling via Scent
  </p>
 
  <p id="p10"> 
  For our initial concept, we explored designing a multi-level floor in which the rabbit can dig based on sensing a scent from a particular area/compartment. Rabbits have a very keen sense of smell and even have scent glants on their chin. While humans have 6 million scent receptors, rabbits have 50 million in comparison (and 100 million scent cells). Therefore, combining their keen sense of smell with a digging machine, we hope to increase the rabbits' ability to dig.
