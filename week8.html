  Inspiring Digging/Burrowing to Evade Predators

  The European rabbit, which originated in France and Northwest Africa, is the common ancestor of the various (80+) breeds of domestic rabbits that we have today. While these wild rabbits—having been introduced to most continents except Asia and Antarctica—are now considered pests in many areas such as Australia where they are destroying ecosystems, their population is diminishing in their region of origin (Europe), putting them on the IUCN red list for this area.
