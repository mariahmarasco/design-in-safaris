Course Objective
</p>

<p id="p4">
This course served as an interaction design course where the target users were animals. Projects in this portfolio range from animals in the zoo setting to wild animals and captive breeding programs. Project objectives also span from creation of empathy on the human-side to enrichment and training devices for animals.
