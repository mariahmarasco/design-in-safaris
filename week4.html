  Proposal 1: Pouncing on unseen, sound-detected food
  </p>
 
  <p id="p2"> 
  In the wild, arctic foxes (omnivores) hunt for food be listening carefully for sounds of prey moving beneath the snow. While they are not always accurate, they can pin-point a snack under 3 feet of snow. Pretty impressive. However, feeding methods in zoos can sometimes be less of a challenge. Therefore, I propose an enrichment plan to get the arctic fox pouncing for prey/food in the way they do in the wild to enhance their precision-hunter instincts.
  <br />
  <br />This enrichment tool would consist of a noise-making food container device paired with a rectangular "snow pit". This pit would be filled with snow (or synthetic snow depending on the zoo's environment and capabilities). Underneath the pit there would be a trap door that zookeepers could open to place the noise-making food machine in without the arctic fox witnessing. Either via a remote control or randomized automation, the food device would move underneath the snow/synthetic snow. The hope would be for the fox to adapt to this feeding tactic, and perhaps even become more precise than wild arctic foxes. Overtime, the snow would get deeper (in increments of 1/2 an inch), increasing the challenge for the fox. The standard for foxes in the wild is 3 feet, so it would be interesting to explore if they can go up to 4 feet. In addition, a timing-based training could come into play so that the fox learns to return to the snow pit at similar time intervals in search of food.
