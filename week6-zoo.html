  ANIMAL CHOICE
  </p>
 
  <p id="p2"> 
  I had previously been researching the Arctic Fox, and really enjoying it. However, because the Central Park Zoo did not have this animal on display, I chose the red panda. I wanted to choose the closest animal I could to an arctic fox and the red panda is similar in size, is also usually a solitary animal (as opposed to social), and is a mammal that walks/runs on all fours.

  ETHOGRAM OBSERVATION
  </p>
 
  <p id="p4">  
  The Ethogram activity was interesting especially because there were two red pandas in the enclosure that were exhibiting very different (almost opposite) behavior. One was sleeping up in a tree while the other was constantly running around the enclosure and climbing branches nonstop. I chose the running red panda to do my official ethogram for, however I took note of these intriguing differences.
