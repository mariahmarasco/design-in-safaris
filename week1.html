Anthropomorphism and Anthropodenial Response

Coming from a background rooted in visual design and conceptual
thinking — having worked in healthcare advertising as an Art Director for three years after
receiving a B.A. in Graphic Design —I found the reading on Anthropomorphism and
Anthropodenial very interesting and eye-opening. I had never heard of these terms prior
and was intrigued as well as unsure where to place myself once learning about their
break-down and the subcategories within. Where I found this reading the most relevant
was my current interest and projects related to animation and motion graphics as well
as character development.
  
<br><br>
  
Since joining the MFA Design & Technology program at Parsons, I have become
very enamored with the world of animation and am currently enrolled in my second
motion graphics course. When I first discovered this design method in the fall, I dug
down to figure out why I was so enamored and where the passion was coming from. I
looked through my old design projects and realized that I had a lot with animals or
abstract characters. I had been interested in creating characters forever, but just hadn’t
realized it on a conscious level.
  
<br><br>

Thinking about these new terms, I realized that I had indeed been using an
anthropomorphistic view to create these characters—“ Kindchenschema” as mentioned
on p. 260. I approached it by thinking about the animals/characters as having the same
emotions that we, as humans, have. They could be happy, excited, sad, angry, insulted,
or embarrassed. In a way, I think animation isn’t wrong if it uses these mindsets to
create animal characters. I find that it helps me relate to an animal group if I see a
character with a name, relationships, and feelings that I am familiar with. When I was a
child, I was terrified of spiders. Seeing the movie Charlotte’s Web and reading Miss
Spider’s Tea Party by David Kirk helped me become less afraid as I could relate to the
characters and see them as friendly beings. Therefore, I think this can actually be used
in a positive manner to help humans be more compassionate with animals and
hopefully therefore care more about their habitat and our environment as a whole.
Animals can also be used as strategic tools in addressing human-related subjects to
make a story more digestible like, for example, in George Orwell’s 1984 . Is this method
an exploitation of animals, though?

<br><br>
  
I found it very interesting to think about anthropodenial and the idea that we
might be overestimating humans’ mental capacity and underestimating animals’ mental
capacity. Per Hume’s discussion on p. 259, he argues that “When any hypothesis,
therefore, is advanc'd to explain a mental operation, which is common to men and
beasts, we must apply the same hypothesis to both”. Therefore in the future I would
approach character animation by considering that they may be on the same mental
wavelength as humans or that humans may be on the same wavelength as the animals
with which they interact. Yet I would also challenge myself to experiment with more
realistic depictions of animals and their harsh living conditions in the spirit of de Waal’s
observation that “the fact that animals kill and devour one another, die of starvation and
disease, or are indifferent to one another does not fit the increasingly popular image of
animals as noble savages” (p. 261).

<br><br>
  
In the framework of this class, I plan to channel anthropomorphism in the context
of Shepard’s argument (p. 262) that anthropomorphism draws us as humans closer to
animals and the natural world and that allows for a world in which we are interested in
learning about and from animals as a means of researching solutions for our own lives.
Being in the Design & Technology program, I have seen that many of the technological
solutions and advancements of today focus solely on human life and don’t remotely
consider the implications for wildlife and the natural world. Being that we are in the
anthropocene, we must move forward as designers and creators with a mindset that
considers these implications or else the planet and its ecosystems will continue to
deplete at an exponential rate, keeping the German term “Umwelt” in mind (p. 265).

<br><br>
  
Overall, I believe it is important to understand the differences between
animalcentric anthropomorphism and anthropocentric anthropomorphism (p. 265).
Working in healthcare advertising, I was used to solving human-related problems in a
way that only thought about the humans specifically involved. I am looking forward to
exercising a different way of thinking by going directly to the animals and the specific
problems they face before considering applications to humans. Of course, applying
these learnings or ways of practice to humans could be helpful and interesting, it should
not be the guiding factor in all cases.
