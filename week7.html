  Inspiring Digging in the Domestic Rabbit

  For the midterm, Tinsley and I were inspired to try and think about engagement for a domestic rabbit. We came upon the idea for this animal focus after thinking about wildlife that you can see in an urban environment. One interesting thing we found was that while wild rabbits (specifically the Eastern Cottontail) were once roaming the parks in Manhattan and its Boroughs, their population dwindled and the last one was seen in Central Park in 2006.
  <br>
  <br>We then began looking at domestic rabbits and the differences between these species and their wild cousins, only to find out that (primarily due to the speed at which rabbits breed) rabbits have been banned from pet shops in NYC due to overpopulation of domestic rabbits in shelters around the city. This got us thinking about how we could encourage a wild behavior in a domestic rabbit population so that if they ever had to return to the wild (unfortunately, it is common for rabbit owners to drop unwanted rabbits into the wild) they would be better suited for survival.
