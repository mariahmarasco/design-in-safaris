Captive Breeding Programs: 
<br>Increasing Survival in New England Cottontails 
<br>Reintroduced into the Wild
</p>
  
<p id="p4">
Final project done in partnership with Tinsley Huo
<br><br>The New England Cottontail was once abundant in the Northeastern United States. However, it's population has dwindled since 1960 primarily due to human development's impact on the Cottontail's environment in combination with infringement from the only other rabbit species seen in the region today, the Eastern Cottontail. This new species was introduces by hunting organizations and is not native to the region, but due to it's keener eye sight as compared to the New England Cottontail, it survives more predator attacks leaving the New England Cottontail more vulnerable. A serious decrease in thicket habitat has also led to this decline, giving less hiding places to the rabbit and forcing them to travel farther from the hiding places that exist in order to forage for food.
<br><br>Since 2010, there has been a grand effort by 6 states partnering to increase the New England Cottontail population through captive breeding programs primarily run out of the Roger Williams Zoo in Rhode Island, the Queens Zoo in New York, and organizations out of Maine and New Hampshire. The other states include Massacusetts and Connecticut.
<br><br>The rabbits were listed on the endangered list until 2015, when it was deemed that the 6-state effort to increase the population with captive breeding and release posed a positive outlook for the species. However, in 2017 in the Department of Inland Fishers (Maine) release effort, most of the 18 New England cottontails brought into the state died primarily due to predation.

Antipredator Response Behavior: Bolting to Low Cover 
</p>
  
<p id="p4">
Unlike some other rabbits, New England Cottontails do not exhibit digging behavior. When in the presence of a detected predator, the Cottontail will sometimes freeze in an attempt to blend in. However, if the predator gets too close, the rabbit will bolt (can run up to 18mph) to a place of cover that is close by such as beneath a hedge, inside a thicket, or underneath a deck like shown in the below video. 
<br><br>However, the primary factor for the decrease in New England Cottontails has been cited as habitat decline. With less secure places like thickets, the rabbits have to travel farther from their safe place to forage. Then, often times they are not close enough to a hiding place to successfully escape when facing a predator. Captive-bred rabbits that are released into the wild face this issue gravely.
