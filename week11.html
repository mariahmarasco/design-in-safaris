  Behavioral Background
  </p>
 
  <p id="p2"> 
  For my Enrichment project earlier this semester, I did extensive research about the arctic fox. I was very interested in the animal and would look forward to continuing to work on this animal for my final project. This project would be centered around enrichment for arctic foxes that are in a zoo environment who don't often get the opportunity to hunt for prey and exercise their unique ability to pin-point the location of prey underneath layers of snow using their keen sense of sound and natural compass. I seek to produce a platform floor that the arctix fox would be able to approach during feeding time and then pounce to stop a sound that was playing underneath the floor in order to obtain the food. More details about the mechanics can be seen in Week 5.

  For form, Arctic Foxes main prey are the Lemming. Lemming's make high pitched squeaking noises, therefore the piezo buzzer would produce a sound within this range to be familiar for the fox to its natural prey. The casing will consist of a pressurized floor (similar to that of a ballet or gymnastics studio with some flexible give).

  After reflecting upon my first prototype back from week 5, I decided to think further about how the platform would be multi-layered so that the feeding device could move about underneath the ground like a Lemming would
