  Concept 1: Arctic Fox Prey Floor
  </p>
 
  <p id="p2"> 
  For my Enrichment project earlier this semester, I did extensive research about the arctic fox. I was very interested in the animal and would look forward to continuing to work on this animal for my final project. This project would be centered around enrichment for arctic foxes that are in a zoo environment who don't often get the opportunity to hunt for prey and exercise their unique ability to pin-point the location of prey underneath layers of snow using their keen sense of sound and natural compass. I seek to produce a platform floor that the arctix fox would be able to approach during feeding time and then pounce to stop a sound that was playing underneath the floor in order to obtain the food. More details about the mechanics can be seen in Week 5.

  Research on Urban Wild Animals
  </p>
 
  <p id="p2"> 
  During the midterm where I worked on the New England Cottontail rabbit and looking at how something could augment the success of the captive breeding programs that are already in place around the region, I became interested in exploring further animals especially ones that are present in smaller numbers around New York City and how something can be created to help make their experience more natural and less interrupted by the busyness of the city and its vast human population. <a href="https://animalstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1000&context=ethnawel">This article</a> talks about human's impact on animals which got me thinking further and led me to research owls in NYC.

  Concept 2: NYC Owls (Saw-Whet & Eastern Screech)
  </p>
 
  <p id="p2"> 
  Researcher Robert DeCandido, PhD, and Animal Photographer Deborah Allen have been working on <a href="https://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/administration_pdf/1010owlsnyc.pdf">conservation and research</a> around the owls in NYC. Since 1998, there has been a program in Central Park to release more owls into the wild setting. At a time, they were able to successfully release 33 owls that bred and reproduced after being introduced to Central Park. Reasons for their decline <a href="https://guides.nynhp.org/barn-owl/">cited </a> include habitat loss, pestocide poisoning, and car collisions to a lesser extent.
  <br>
  <br><a href="https://www.hawkcreek.org/wp/barn-owls/">One breeding program</a> was told by the state of New York that they were not able to continue with their conservation and release efforts due to a lack of proof that the program was working. They cite the only way in which they will be able to prove it is working is if owl sightings are increased. Therefore, I wonder if I can create something that would attract owls to areas closer to humans where they have a greater chance of being seen (without being harmed of course) and therefore a greater chance for the species to survive in this region of the United States.
  <br>
  <br>Owls have a keep sense of hearing and often use this to detect their prey. I would propose to create a low-cost solution and device that could be placed in areas closer to humans (where people can record sightings) that would challenge the owl to locate the sound of prey from inside a box that they cannot see into. They would associate that this box gives food if they peck on the appropriate spot and continue to return to the box in the future for different iterations on the challenge.

  Concept 3: A Better Purpose for the Raccoon
  </p>
 
  <p id="p2"> 
  For my 3rd proposal, I looked at another animal that is often affected by humans and also affects humans in a negative way, the raccoon. When I was growing up, my family used to camp in Maine at Acadia National Park every Labor Day Weekend. I remember us having to tie our tents shut strategically so that raccoons were less likely or able to break in and steal our things. On camp sites, raccoons pose a very real problem for humans as they are extremely smart and their hand physiology allows them to be able to open lids, zippers, clasps, etc. However, these animals are important to the ecosystem. I want to explore a way in which an enrichment can be created for raccoons to help both the raccoons (playing with or messing with an obejct built for them would be a lot safer than messing with human belongings that could contain chokables or harmful chemicals), and also humans by detracting raccoons from their campsites.
  <br>
  <br>After researching, I have found that there are many "raccoon-proof" tools that humans can buy on Amazon, etc. as well as some basic raccoon enrichments that campsites have implemented such as the one in the image below. However, the problem still seems to persist so I want to work towards creating something that is better than what is already in existence and instead of separating the raccoon finding human belongings and finding an enrichment device, I wonder if there is a way to combine the two and actually address the raccoon at the point of contact with human belongings.
