  Captive Breeding Programs: 
  <br>Increasing Survival in Cottontails Reintroduced into the Wild
  </p>
 
  <p id="p2"> 
  The New England Cottontail was once abundant in the Northeastern United States. However, it's population has dwindled since 1960 primarily due to human development's impact on the Cottontail's environment in combination with infringement from the only other rabbit species seen in the region today, the Eastern Cottontail. This new species was introduces by hunting organizations and is not native to the region, but due to it's keener eye sight as compared to the New England Cottontail, it survives more predator attacks leaving the New England Cottontail more vulnerable. A serious decrease in thicket habitat has also led to this decline, giving less hiding places to the rabbit and forcing them to travel farther from the hiding places that exist in order to forage for food.
