  Captive Breeding Programs: 
  <br>Increasing Survival in Cottontails Reintroduced into the Wild
  </p>
 
  <p id="p2"> 
  The European rabbit, which originated in France and Northwest Africa, is the common ancestor of the various 80+ breeds of domestic rabbits that we have today. While these wild rabbits—having been introduced to most continents except Asia and Antarctica—are now considered pests in many areas such as Australia where they are destroying ecosystems, their population is diminishing in their region of origin (Europe), putting them on the IUCN red list for this area.

  Impact of Predator Types on Form
  </p>
 
  <p id="p6"> 
  The New England Cottontail's most common predators include the red fox, coyote, hawks, and owls. Our design incorporates an opening that is both small (keeps the rabbits safe from foxes and coyotes that won't fit) and ground-level (keeps the rabbits safe from birds of prey that approach from above).

  Antipredator Response Behavior: Bolting to Low Cover
  </p>
 
  <p id="p6"> 
  Unlike some other rabbits, New England Cottontails do not exhibit digging behavior. When in the presence of a detected predator, the Cottontail will sometimes freeze in an attempt to blend in. However, if the predator gets too close, the rabbit will bolt (can run up to 18mph) to a place of cover that is close by such as beneath a hedge, inside a thicket, or underneath a deck like shown in the below video.
  <br>
  <br>However, the primary factor for the decrease in New England Cottontails has been cited as habitat decline. With less secure places like thickets, the rabbits have to travel farther from their safe place to forage. Then, often times they are not close enough to a hiding place to successfully escape when facing a predator. Captive-bred rabbits that are released into the wild face this issue gravely.

  Future Evolution of Form
  </p>
 
  <p id="p6"> 
  In it's current form, the device is on the smaller side and could perhaps make the rabbit feel stressed because they cannot get significantly far away from the predator smell. Ideally, it would be a longer, thinner rectangular environment so that the rabbit could go a significant distance to the other end of the environment and dig to evade the predator.
  <br> 
  <br> Tubes need to be added on the cieling for scent delivery and a top layer for housing the arduino mechanism needs to be created (as shown in demo video). Also, we are figuring out the best material to use for delivering the predator scent(s). One consideration is fox urine or a foxtail.

  Questions
  </p>
 
  <p id="p6"> 
  1. What battery is needed to power a servo? The one that comes in Arduino Starter Kit is too weak. 
  <br>2. Is there a motor that can do 360 degrees? Servo only does 180.
